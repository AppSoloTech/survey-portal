## Baseline — Documentation Audit

Date:
2026-06-08

Status:
Completed

Scope:
Reusable workflow documentation baseline before application scaffolding.

Decisions:

- `prompts/MASTER_PRODUCT_CONTEXT.txt` is the product source of truth.
- `markdown/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` is the architecture source of truth.
- `markdown/DATA_MODEL_VISION.md` is durable data-model guidance, subordinate to product and architecture decisions.
- `markdown/GLOBAL_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.txt` records local and Azure environment assumptions.
- `prompts/` holds phase prompts only; durable product and environment context lives in `markdown/`.
- `notes/` will hold phase-specific Claude handoffs and review outputs.
- Azure App Service and Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server are the MVP deployment targets.

Open items for Phase 0:

- choose and document exact Node.js and npm versions
- decide database migration tooling
- decide frontend build tooling
- verify the active `.env` remains ignored and contains no production secrets

Validation:

- Documentation consistency scan performed.
- `.env.example` created with placeholder-only local development values.
- No application code exists yet, so typecheck/build/runtime validation is not applicable.
